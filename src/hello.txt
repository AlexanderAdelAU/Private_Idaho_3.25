Welcome to Private Idaho v3.2 the 32 bit edition
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

PI32 version 3.2 is a major upgrade to hopefully simplify the task of
encrypted email.  I felt the previous version required to much expert
to run.  I therefore apologise for any 'advanced features' that have
been removed. I have used my judgement in the simplification process so
if anything has been removed that you believe should remain please do
not hesitate to email me.

Features of PI 3.2
1. Mail Folders
2. UU-Encoding and Base 64 encoding support
3. Multi-part messages support for mixmaster
4. Mixmaster can reside in any 8.3 directory.
5. Better support for newsgroup posting
6. Better support for remailers.


Technical Stuff for Private Idaho 3.2 beta
----------------------------------------------

Before you start
---------------

You must install PGP if you wish to use PI with it.  Otherwise PI
will not be able to encrypt any messages.  Make sure you have the 
correct settings in the autoexec.bat file and after you have installed
PGP do this.

1.  Use the windows explorer and open the PGP directory (eg C:\PGP)
2.  Find PGP.EXE and "right click on PGP.EXE"
3.  Click on "Properties"
4.  Click on the "Program" tab
5.  In the "Working Directory"  type in "C:\PGP

Now if you have installed mixmaster then do the same for it. 

If you follow the guidance above, this the necessary "DOS" files will be 
created and your life will be a zillion times more pleasant as PI will
likely work first time.


What is PI 32
-------------
This is a new 32-bit beta release of Private Idaho (a PGP, anonymous
remailer, and nym server front-end for Windows).  This document
updates any information found in the help file.  The current
publicly available help files relate to v2.8b3, the last beta
release of PI.  This release came out during May, 1998.  A new version
of the help manual will appear both in web form and will be 
available for download as a word document on the internet.

Source Code for earlier versions:
------------
Private Idaho is unsupported freeware, licensed under the GNU
General Public License.  The licensing agreement is found in the
license.txt file, distributed with this application.  See:

http://www.eskimo.com/~joelm/pi.html


DOS Limits
Because PI shells to a DOS version of PGP you must place PI
in a directory that conforms to the DOS 8.3 standard.  Thus
1.  PI should be in DRIVE:\PI32
2.  PGP should be in DRIVE:\PGP

Also because of the 128 character DOS command limit
you will need to be careful when using mixmaster, especially when
posting to newsgroups.  Unfortunately, there is no way to
get around the 128 character limit at present.  However, I have
shaved characters from the command stream wherever possible.  I
have also provided a count when the stream exceeds 128 to give
you an idea of the length of the string.  Usually, the limit
will not be exceeded except in the case of encrypting to self
plus signing plus encrypting for multiple recipients.


Installation
------------
SETUPEX.EXE is a self-extracting compressed installation program.
It installs and registers all of the required files to run Private 
Idaho.  The installer includes an unistaller which will be added 
to the PI program group.

If you're updating a previous previous of Private Idaho, PI-SETUP will
only replace older files.  The new version does not destroy any information
you have saved in your PIDAHO.INI settings file which is located in 
the windows directory.

If for some reason you have problems with the installation, you can
manually copy the files look at the file pi32.dep which will list all the
files that should have been installed on your system.


Mixmaster and Private Idaho
---------------------------
Mixmaster (or Type II) remailers offer a high level of security 
(see http://www.obscura.com/~loki for complete details).  Up until now,
Mixmaster has only been available to UNIX users.  Mixmaster's author, 
Lance Cottrell, has recently released a DOS client version of the 
application that works with Private Idaho 2.7b (and later).

Since the Mixmaster client uses export-controlled cryptography, it is not
included with Private Idaho.  Refer to http://www.obscura.com/~loki for 
information on how to get a copy of MIXMASTE.ZIP (the compressed version
of Mixmaster and its support files).  

To be able to send messages through Mixmaster remailers you need several 
files:

MIXMASTE.EXE - the Mixmaster client
MIXMASTE.CON - a support file
PUBRING.MIX - the list of Mixmaster remailer keys
TYPE2.LIS - the list of Mixmaster remailers
MIXMSTR.TXT - statistics on Mixmaster remailers
MIX.PIF - the PIF file for shelling to the DOS application

These files are included in the MIXMASTE.ZIP file.  Uncompress the files and
move them to any directory.  PI will look for them and provided it is in a 8.3 
directory it should work fine.

After you've installed these files, in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file add the 
following line:

SET MIXPATH=C:\PI32

with the directory path specifying the Private Idaho directory.  Reboot your 
computer and run Private Idaho.

Using Mixmaster remailers with Private Idaho is no different than using 
Cypherpunk style remailers.  Select Mixmaster from the Remailers menu, 
compose and address your message, select the remailer(s) from the drop-down
list box to use, and choose Append info from the Message menu.

Private Idaho will shell out to the DOS version of Mixmaster, and prepare 
the message for sending.

You'll need to update information about Mixmaster remailers, just like 
Cypherpunk remailers.  Specifically the PUBRING.MIX, TYPE2.LIS, and
MIXMSTR.TXT files.  You can do this over the Net with the new update
remailer info command.
